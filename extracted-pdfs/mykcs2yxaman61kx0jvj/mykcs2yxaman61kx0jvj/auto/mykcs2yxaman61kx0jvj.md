Calculate the time complexity for thefollowingexpressions byiteration method:  

i)T(n)=2T（n/2)+n2. $T(1)=1$ ii)T(n)=4T(n/2) $\pm\Pi_{i}$ T（1)=1 $T(n)=2T(n-2)+C_{\prime}$ $T(0)=1$

2. Generate therelation/expression oftimecomplexity for the following piece of codeand subsequently calculateits timecomplexity.  

int oper(int a[],int n,int s) if $(n<0)$ return(-1); if(a[n-1] $==5$ return (n-1); else return oper(a,n-2,s);  

A stack ADT operates by push and pop furctions with top being the index pointer. A queue ADT operates by enqueue and dequeue operations with front and rear indexpointers.Implement a queue by using a stack underneath (with array).This means that the enqueue and dequeue functions in turn should call relevant push and pop operations to implement the queue ADT.Write the pseudocode for this enqueue and dequeue operations and justify their correspondingtimecomplexities.

Perform topological sorting on the above directed graph.  

Now, for performing Depth First Traversal,assume that all the edges in the graph are undirected.Generate,step by step,the resultant output of Depth First Traversal,along with the finishing time for all the vertices, starting from thevertexA.  

NOTE:The adjacencymatrix/listhas the following orderA,D,E,F,C,B.  

The cable company has to put down the cables which can connect all the six houses（A,B,C,D,E,F）and itwishestominimizethecostof cabling.UsePrim algorithm(usingAas the source)to showin a stepby step manner how thiscan be achieved.The resultant connections and the total cost should also be provided.The costmatrix for the houses is given below.A positive value in (i) cell represents a cabling cost between house iand housej,Omeans no cost and inf signifiesno cabling can be done.

Simulate schematically how the following entries are added/enqueued (and adjusted) in this priority queue by using a min heap. Show the status of insert enqueue operation.

Consequently,delete the keys 8 and 4in sequence from the generated tree.   
Reveal the status of the tree after each insertion and deletion operation.
